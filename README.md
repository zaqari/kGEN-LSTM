# kGEN-LSTM
An LSTM built in Keras that includes a  300D dep2vec layer and two hidden relu layers.

To whomever is reading: congrats You've found my LSTM shell! The data used in this experiment is stored via google drive in order to 
be able to share the larger files, including the word vector models. To access those/collaborate, please shoot me an email.
